Code Structure and Functionality

1. int getMatrixEdgeLength(int *matrix, int n, int i, int j)
- Purpose: Returns the edge length between vertices `i` and `j` from an adjacency matrix.
    - Parameters:
    - `matrix`: Pointer to the adjacency matrix.
    - `n`: Number of vertices.
    - `i`: Starting vertex index.
    - `j`: Ending vertex index.
    - Returns: Edge length between vertices `i` and `j`.

    2. int getLinkedListLength(listnode* start, int n, int *dist)
    - Purpose: Calculates the total length of the path represented by a linked list of vertices.
    - Parameters:
    - `start`: Pointer to the start of the linked list.
    - `n`: Number of vertices (not used in the function).
    - `dist`: Pointer to the adjacency matrix.
    - Returns: Total length of the path from the start vertex to the end vertex in the linked list.

    3. struct listnode *copyListAndAddNode(listnode *inputList, int vertexNumToAdd)
    - Purpose: Creates a copy of a linked list and adds a new node with the value `vertexNumToAdd` at the end.
    - Parameters:
    - `inputList`: Pointer to the original linked list.
    - `vertexNumToAdd`: Value of the new node to be added.
    - Returns: Pointer to the new linked list with the additional node.

    4. struct listnode *shortest_path(int n, int s, int t, int *dist)
    - Purpose: Finds the shortest path from vertex `s` to vertex `t` using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm.
    - Parameters:
    - `n`: Number of vertices.
    - `s`: Start vertex index.
    - `t`: Target vertex index.
    - `dist`: Pointer to the adjacency matrix.
    - Returns: Pointer to a linked list representing the shortest path from vertex `s` to vertex `t`.

    5. int main(void)
    - Purpose: Initializes a distance matrix for a graph with 1000 vertices, runs the `shortest_path` function to find the shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 999, and prints the result.
    - Details:
    - Constructs a distance matrix with various edge lengths.
    - Calls `shortest_path` to get the shortest path and prints the path.

    Key Points
    - The code uses a linked list to represent paths and a distance matrix to store edge weights.
    - The `shortest_path` function employs a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm, but with a non-standard implementation for path copying and distance updates.
    - The `main` function tests the algorithm with a specific graph and prints the path.
